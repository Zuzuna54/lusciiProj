# Notes API Project Guidelines

This project implements a lightweight Notes API with three core endpoints:
- `POST /notes` — Add a new note
- `GET /notes` — Retrieve all notes
- `DELETE /notes/:id` — Delete a note by ID

## Core Principles
- Use Node.js with TypeScript
- Implement in-memory storage (no database required)
- Maintain clear, modular, and maintainable code
- Handle errors securely (avoid exposing stack traces or internal logic)
- Include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Document thoroughly for team understanding and future AWS deployment

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── controllers/    # Request handlers
├── middleware/     # Custom middleware
├── models/         # Data models
├── routes/         # API route definitions
├── services/       # Business logic
├── utils/          # Helper functions
└── app.ts          # Main application file
tests/              # Test files
```

## Development Flow
Follow the 5-phase development approach:
1. Project Setup and Basic Structure
2. Core API Functionality
3. Error Handling and Security
4. Testing
5. Documentation and AWS Integration Planning

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Write clean, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Create modular and testable components
