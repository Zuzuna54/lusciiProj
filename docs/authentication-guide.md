# Authentication Integration Guide

This guide provides instructions for integrating Amazon Cognito authentication with the Notes API.

## Overview

The authentication integration involves:

1. Setting up Amazon Cognito
2. Creating authentication middleware
3. Securing API endpoints
4. Testing the authentication flow

## Amazon Cognito Setup

Amazon Cognito provides user authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications. It offers features like sign-up, sign-in, multi-factor authentication, and identity federation.

### Key Components

1. **User Pool**: A user directory that manages user identities
2. **App Client**: Grants permissions to call unauthenticated API operations
3. **Identity Pool**: Provides temporary AWS credentials to authorized users

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

### 2. Create Authentication Utilities

### 3. Update Routes to Use Authentication

### 4. Update Controllers to Use Authenticated User ID

### 5. Update App Configuration

### 6. Update Environment Variables


## Implementing Social Identity Providers

To allow users to sign in with their social media accounts:

1. Register your app with the identity provider (Google, Facebook, etc.)
2. Configure the identity provider in Cognito User Pool
3. Update client-side sign-in to use the identity provider

Example configuration for Google:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console and create OAuth credentials
2. In Cognito User Pool, go to "Identity providers" and select "Google"
3. Enter Client ID and Client Secret from Google
4. Add the authorized callback URL: `https://<your-cognito-domain>.auth.<region>.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse`

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

To enable MFA:

1. Go to your User Pool in Cognito
2. Under "MFA and verifications", set MFA to "Optional" or "Required"
3. Select the MFA methods (SMS, TOTP, etc.)

## Advanced Security Features

1. Enable advanced security features in Cognito User Pool settings
2. Configure risk-based adaptive authentication
3. Set up compromised credentials detection
