# Phase 4: Testing

With the Notes API functionality, error handling, and security measures implemented in Phases 1-3, this phase focuses on comprehensive testing to ensure the API works correctly under various conditions.

## Tasks

### 4.1 Set Up Testing Framework

- Configure Jest or Mocha as the test runner
- Set up a test environment configuration:
  - Create a separate test configuration file
  - Configure environment variables for testing
- Implement test utilities and helpers:
  - Request helper for API testing
  - Test data generators
  - Test database reset functions

### 4.2 Implement Unit Tests for Services

- Create unit tests for the Note service (`tests/unit/services/noteService.test.ts`):
  - Test `createNote` functionality
  - Test `getAllNotes` functionality
  - Test `getNote` functionality
  - Test `deleteNote` functionality
  - Test edge cases (e.g., deleting non-existent notes)
- Mock any dependencies to isolate the service layer
- Ensure high code coverage for the service layer

### 4.3 Implement Unit Tests for Controllers

- Create unit tests for the Notes controller (`tests/unit/controllers/notesController.test.ts`):
  - Test POST request handling
  - Test GET request handling
  - Test DELETE request handling
  - Test error handling for each endpoint
- Mock the service layer to isolate controller logic
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### 4.4 Implement Integration Tests

- Create integration tests for API endpoints (`tests/integration/notes.test.ts`):
  - Test the complete request-response cycle
  - Test successful creation, retrieval, and deletion of notes
  - Test validation errors (e.g., empty content, invalid IDs)
  - Test error responses with correct status codes and formats
- Implement a test setup and teardown process to reset the in-memory database between tests

### 4.5 Implement Security Tests

- Test rate limiting functionality:
  - Verify that requests are limited after exceeding thresholds
  - Test rate limit response format
- Test input validation and sanitization:
  - Test responses to malformed inputs
  - Test handling of potentially harmful inputs
- Test security headers:
  - Verify that appropriate headers are set
  - Ensure sensitive headers are not exposed

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unit tests for all service and controller methods are implemented
- Integration tests for all API endpoints are implemented
- Tests cover both success and error cases
- Tests verify that security measures work as expected
- Test coverage is at least 80% for core functionality
- All tests pass consistently
- Tests run automatically in a CI environment
- Tests are well-organized and follow a consistent pattern

## Next Steps

With comprehensive testing in place, Phase 5 will focus on documentation and AWS integration planning to prepare for deployment in a serverless environment.
