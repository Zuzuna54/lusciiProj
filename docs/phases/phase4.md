# Phase 5: Documentation and AWS Integration Planning

Building upon the tested Notes API from previous phases, this final phase focuses on comprehensive documentation and planning for AWS serverless deployment.

## Tasks

### 5.1 Create API Documentation

- Install and configure a documentation tool (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI, JSDoc)
- Document each API endpoint:
  - HTTP method and URL
  - Request parameters and body schema
  - Response schema for success and error cases
  - Examples of requests and responses
- Document authentication requirements (for future implementation)
- Generate interactive API documentation that can be served with the API

### 5.2 Create Developer Documentation

- Create a comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Setup instructions
  - API usage examples
  - Development workflow
  - Testing procedures
- Document the project architecture:
  - Component diagram
  - Data flow description
  - Directory structure explanation
- Document coding standards and contribution guidelines

### 5.3 AWS Lambda Integration Planning

- Design the AWS Lambda architecture:
  - Create a diagram showing API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB
  - Define Lambda function configurations (memory, timeout, etc.)
  - Plan for environment variables and configuration management
- Document the required AWS resources:
  - API Gateway configuration
  - Lambda function definitions
  - IAM roles and permissions
  - DynamoDB table design
- Create a deployment plan:
  - Manual deployment steps
  - Automated deployment options (e.g., using AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, or AWS CDK)

### 5.4 DynamoDB Migration Planning

- Design the DynamoDB table structure:
  - Define the primary key and sort key
  - Plan for any secondary indexes
  - Document capacity planning (provisioned vs. on-demand)
- Create a data migration strategy from in-memory to DynamoDB:
  - Update the service layer to use DynamoDB
  - Maintain backward compatibility
  - Testing approach for the DynamoDB integration
- Document DynamoDB access patterns based on API requirements

### 5.5 Authentication Integration Planning

- Document AWS Cognito integration:
  - User pool configuration
  - Identity pool setup (if needed)
  - JWT token validation
- Plan for IAM-based authentication:
  - Required IAM policies
  - API Gateway authorization
  - IAM role configuration
- Create an authentication middleware design:
  - Token validation
  - Role-based access control (if needed)
  - Error handling for authentication failures

### 5.6 Create Monitoring and Operations Documentation

- Design a monitoring strategy:
  - CloudWatch metrics and alarms
  - Logging configuration
  - Error tracking
- Create operational runbooks:
  - Deployment procedures
  - Rollback procedures
  - Troubleshooting guides
- Document scaling considerations for serverless architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

- API is fully documented with an interactive API documentation tool
- README.md provides comprehensive instructions for setup and usage
- AWS Lambda architecture is designed and documented
- DynamoDB migration plan is detailed and implementable
- Authentication integration plan is comprehensive
- Monitoring and operations documentation is complete
- All documentation is clear, accurate, and follows a consistent format
- Documentation addresses all the requirements mentioned in the original assignment

## Project Completion

After completing Phase 5, the Notes API project will be ready for:

- Review by the team
- Deployment to AWS using the documented serverless architecture
- Integration with other applications
- Further enhancement with additional features

The documentation and planning done in this phase ensure that the project can be easily understood, maintained, and extended by other team members.
