# Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

This phase focuses on establishing the foundation for our Notes API by setting up the project structure, installing dependencies, and creating the basic server framework.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Initialize Project

- Create a new directory for the project
- Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and any environment files
- Set up GitHub repository and make initial commit

### 1.2 Install Core Dependencies

- Install Express.js for API routing: `npm install express`
- Install development dependencies:
  - `npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/express @types/node` (if using TypeScript)
  - `npm install --save-dev nodemon jest supertest` (for development and testing)
- Create `package.json` scripts for starting and testing the application

### 1.3 Configure TypeScript

- Initialize TypeScript configuration with `npx tsc --init`
- Configure `tsconfig.json` with appropriate settings:
  - Set target to ES2020 or later
  - Enable strict mode
  - Configure output directory
  - Set module resolution and path mapping

### 1.4 Create Basic Project Structure

- Create the following directories:
  ```
  src/
  ├── controllers/    # Request handlers
  ├── middleware/     # Custom middleware
  ├── models/         # Data models
  ├── routes/         # API route definitions
  ├── services/       # Business logic
  ├── utils/          # Helper functions
  └── app.js          # Main application file
  tests/              # Test files
  ```

### 1.5 Implement Basic Server Setup

- Create the main application file (`src/app.ts`)
- Set up basic Express server with JSON middleware
- Implement a health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
- Create a server startup script that listens on a configurable port

### 1.6 Create Basic Routing Structure

- Create a routes index file (`src/routes/index.ts`)
- Set up a skeleton route handler for the notes endpoints (without implementation)
- Connect routes to the main app

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project structure is established with all necessary directories
- npm packages are installed and package.json is properly configured
- Basic Express server runs without errors and responds to health check endpoint
- Code follows consistent style with proper formatting
- Project can be started with a simple npm command (e.g., `npm start` or `npm run dev`)
- Initial route structure is in place, though endpoints don't need to be functional yet

## Next Steps

Upon completion of Phase 1, we'll have a solid foundation to build upon in Phase 2, where we'll implement the core functionality of our Notes API with in-memory data storage.
