# Notes API Development Phases

This document provides an overview of the development phases for the Notes API project. Each phase builds upon the previous one, incrementally developing the application from initial setup to a production-ready API with comprehensive documentation.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name                                                      | Focus             | Key Deliverables                                      |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | [Project Setup and Basic Structure](./phase1.md)          | Foundation        | Project structure, dependencies, basic Express server |
| 2     | [Core API Functionality](./phase2.md)                     | Core Features     | In-memory data store, three required endpoints        |
| 3     | [Error Handling and Security](./phase3.md)                | Robustness        | Error handling, input validation, security headers    |
| 4     | [Testing](./phase4.md)                                    | Quality Assurance | Unit tests, integration tests, CI setup               |
| 5     | [Documentation and AWS Integration Planning](./phase5.md) | Deployment        | API documentation, AWS architecture design            |

## Development Flow

The development process follows this logical progression:

1. **Phase 1** establishes the foundational project structure and basic server setup
2. **Phase 2** implements the core API functionality with in-memory data storage
3. **Phase 3** enhances the API with robust error handling and security measures
4. **Phase 4** ensures quality through comprehensive testing
5. **Phase 5** prepares for AWS deployment with documentation and planning

## Timelines

Each phase is designed to be completed in a focused development session. The entire project can be completed within a week with the following suggested timeline:

- **Phase 1**: 1 day
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 3**: 1 day
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 5**: 1 day

## Project Requirements

This development plan addresses all requirements specified in the [project requirements](../../requirements.md), including:

- Node.js/TypeScript implementation
- In-memory storage
- Secure error handling
- Unit tests
- Clear and maintainable code
- Documentation for AWS Lambda and DynamoDB implementation
- Authentication planning

## Getting Started

To begin development, start with [Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure](./phase1.md) and progress sequentially through each phase.
