# Phase 3: Error Handling and Security

Building on the functional API created in Phase 2, this phase focuses on implementing robust error handling and security measures to ensure the API is production-ready and secure.

## Tasks

### 3.1 Implement Comprehensive Error Handling

- Create a custom error handler middleware (`src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`)
- Define custom error classes for different error types:
  - `NotFoundError`: For resources not found
  - `ValidationError`: For invalid inputs
  - `InternalServerError`: For unexpected server errors
- Modify the error handler to:
  - Log errors appropriately (without exposing sensitive information)
  - Return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Hide implementation details from error responses
- Implement global unhandled exception and promise rejection handlers

### 3.2 Enhance Input Validation and Sanitization

- Install and configure a validation library (e.g., `joi`, `express-validator`)
- Create validation middleware for each endpoint
- Implement content sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Add validation for:
  - Request body content (for POST requests)
  - URL parameters (for DELETE requests)
  - Query parameters (if any)
- Ensure all validation errors are caught and handled with appropriate responses

### 3.3 Implement Request Rate Limiting

- Install and configure rate limiting middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`)
- Set appropriate limits for different endpoints:
  - More permissive for GET requests
  - Stricter for POST and DELETE requests
- Configure rate limiting to use appropriate storage (memory-based for this project)
- Return meaningful responses when rate limits are exceeded

### 3.4 Add Security Headers

- Install and configure security headers middleware (e.g., `helmet`)
- Configure appropriate security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
- Disable unnecessary headers that might expose system information

### 3.5 Implement Basic Logging

- Create a logging utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
- Log all incoming requests with appropriate information:
  - HTTP method
  - Endpoint
  - Status code
  - Response time
- Log errors with detailed information (for internal use only)
- Ensure sensitive data is not logged

### 3.6 Add Request Validation Middleware

- Create middleware for request validation that can be reused across endpoints
- Ensure consistent error responses for validation failures
- Implement middleware to validate and sanitize all incoming requests

## Acceptance Criteria

- Error handling is comprehensive and returns appropriate status codes
- No internal error details or stack traces are exposed to clients
- All inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
- Security headers are properly configured
- Rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse
- Logging captures relevant information for debugging without exposing sensitive data
- All error responses follow a consistent format:
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "status": 400,
      "message": "Validation failed",
      "details": ["Content is required"]
    }
  }
  ```

## Next Steps

With error handling and security measures in place, Phase 4 will focus on implementing comprehensive testing to ensure the API works correctly under various conditions and edge cases.
